This directory contains changes to let ayacc compile under Alsys on
a PC running DOS.  These changes were contributed by 
Sriram Sankar at Stanford <sankar@cs.stanford.edu>

INSTALLATION: The script 'mvfiles' (run on UNIX) will move copy in the
appropriate files from the main src directory and rename them with file
names suitable for DOS.  The compile.inv file should let you compile the
system once you have the files on your PC.
