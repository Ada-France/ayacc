        AYACC would generate illegal package names given certain input
        file names.  This was previously corrected in the VADS6 version,
        but the change wasn't propogated to the main sources due to an
        error in configuration management.  Thank you to Michael Schwartz
        for pointing this out.

        AYACC wouldn't work under some versions of the ALSYS compiler due
        to an erroneous construct involving order of parameter evaluation
        in the file lalr_symbol_info_body.a.  Thank you to
        delaunay@ensisun.imag.fr for this fix.

        Added checks and error messages for parse stack overflow in
        generated parsers.  Thank you to Susan Eilers <suef@kaman.COM>
        for these patches.

        AYACC would fail silently if it couldn't open it's output files.

        The ada_parser example (which is very frequently used as a basis
        for tools) had some errors which caused it to reject legal code.
        S A McConnell <sam@iberia.cca.cr.rockwell.COM> contributed a
        set of revisions which allow the ada_parser to parse the entire
        ACVC 1.11 collection.
